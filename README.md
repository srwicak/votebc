# CodeIgniter 4 Application Starter

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

You can read the [user guide](https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/)
corresponding to the latest version of the framework.

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use GitHub issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.

## Server Requirements

PHP version 8.1 or higher is required, with the following extensions installed:

- [intl](http://php.net/manual/en/intl.requirements.php)

## Troubleshooting

### Duplicate entry for key `votes.votes_voter_id_idx` when voting

If you see an error like:

"Duplicate entry 'X' for key 'votes.votes_voter_id_idx'",

it means your database has a UNIQUE index on `votes.voter_id`, which incorrectly prevents a user from voting in more than one election. The intended rule is: a user may vote once per election (unique on `(election_id, voter_id)`), while single-column indexes should be non-unique for performance only.

Fix:

1) Run the migrations to drop the wrong unique index and recreate proper indexes:

```
php spark migrate
```

What this does:
- Drops any UNIQUE single-column indexes on `votes` (including `votes_voter_id_idx`).
- Recreates them as non-unique indexes.
- Ensures a composite UNIQUE index on `(election_id, voter_id)` exists.

Notes:
- If you run multiple environments, run the migration in each one.
- Application logic already checks duplicates per election via `VoteModel::hasVoted($electionId, $voterId)`.
